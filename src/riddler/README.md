Solutions to 538's Riddler prompts. Casually solved these manually for a long
time, but most of them seem solvable with code so I'm doing that where
reasonable.

Primary motivation here is to beat my dad. He solves these every week, and
likes to issue them as challenges to me whenever they are of the optimization
variety.
